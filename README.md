### **Description**
Put simply Crypto piggy is a platform that enables crypto holders to maximize the value in saving thier crypto.

But that does not sum it up. We have built a completely new protocol ([FIS Protocol](./blockend/contracts/FIS_Protocol.sol/)) that works with the sole purpose of incentivizing users to save securly, and socially.

CryptoPiggy is made up of savings(tokens data), FIS Coin, social savings groups, and vetted investment opportunities.

**Heres a breakdown to understand how CryptoPiggy works**:
1. TLOS: From the user account page we allow you to move your telos to Piggy, set a savings goal and duration.

2. We support any ERC20 Token: Users Approve the contract to take the tokens and then add the amount to the contract.

3. Saving Groups and Circles: A user has a group of addresses they are connected to by permissions. This list of addresses is called a *circle*. When a user creates a social savings group, they set a goal e.g. "We are saving to by our first Car", a target amount "100TLOS", a duration (6 months) etc. The Group visibility can be public or just within your circle.

4. Investments: Also called vetted opportunities, through a governing system the contract admin can post investment opportunities e.g "Chickin farm in Virginia", for users to convert from their savings balance. An investment uses the FIS protocol to create a profit risk investment. Meaning you can only lose what you were expecting to gain.

5. The smart contract.


### **Tech**
This is a web3 app interacting with the TLOS Chain
1. Ethers 6+ for interaction
2. Next.js 14 for Frontend
3. Solidity for contract



### What value does this all bring.
1. CryptoPiggy introduces a system that incentivises the crypto community to save. Currently we are incentivised to spend.

2. Even if you are not a fan of savings. This provides a more secure decentralized location for your token. Wallets get compromized everyday. Smart contracts don't have private keys and thus limited hacks.

3. We promote a social finance system by enabling users work together to save.

4. Instead of letting that cash just sit in your wallet, or any savings protocols, You can turn it into a Fair Investment (Risk = +-Profit).
